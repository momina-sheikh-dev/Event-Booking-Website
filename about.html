    <h1>Our Event History</h1>
    <p class="font">
        It all began with a party. While pledging a national fraternity at the University of Iowa, young Donald S. "Buck" Freeman discovered his passion for party decorating and parades. Buck saw an opportunity to use his enthusiasm for bringing people together to create meaningful experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="font">
        A true visionary, Buck firmly believed in creating personal relationships in an impersonal world. As Freeman grew from a humble decorating company to servicing trade shows, conferences, and events across the country, Buck's commitment to building these meaningful customer relationships became infused throughout the organization.
    </p>
    <p class="font">
        Our never-ending drive to meet customers' ever-changing needs — and to do it better than anyone else — has grown Freeman to one of the world's leading event companies.
